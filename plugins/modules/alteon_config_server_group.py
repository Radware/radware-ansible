      slb_metric:
        description:
          - The metric used to select next server in the group.
          - In C(leastConnections), Alteon sends the incoming connections to the real port with the least number of connections.
          - In C(roundRobin), when an available server is selected, Alteon ensures even distribution when choosing a real port to receive the incoming connection.
          - C(minMisses) is optimized for cache redirection. Alteon calculates a value for each available real server based on the relevant IP address information in the client request. The server with the highest value is assigned the connection. This metric attempts to minimize the disruption of persistence when servers are removed from service. Use only when persistence is required.
          - In C(response), Alteon uses the response time between itself and real servers as a weighting factor. Alteon monitors and records the amount of time it takes for each real server to reply to a health check to adjust the real server weights. The weights are adjusted so they are inversely proportional to a moving average of response time. In such a scenario, a server with half the response time as another server receives a weight twice as large.
          - In C(bandwidth), Alteon monitors the number of octets sent between itself and real servers. Servers that process more octets are considered to have less available bandwidth. Alteon assigns requests client requests to the server with the greatest available bandwidth. When the upload and download bandwidths are configured for WAN link groups, Alteon calculates the server bandwidth based on bandwidth utilization, not on octets.
          - In C(hash), Alteon selects the real server based on a hash of the client IP address.
          - In C(phash), Alteon selects the real server based on a hash of the client IP address. With Persistent Hash enabled, Alteon supports an even load distribution (Hash) and stable server assignment (Minmiss) even when a server in the group goes down. With the Persistent Hash metric, the first hash always is the same even if a real server is down. If the first hash hits an unavailable server, Alteon rehashes the client request based on the actual number of servers available. This results in a request always being sent to a server that is available.
          - In C(svcLeast), Alteon selects the real server based only on the number of active connections for the service which is load balanced, and not the total number of connections active on the server. For example, when selecting a real server for a new HTTP session, a real server serving one HTTP connection and 20 FTP connections takes precedence over a real server serving two HTTP connections only.

          - If the real server group becomes unavailable, Alteon activates the backup real server or real server group until one of the original real servers becomes available again.
          - The backup server or real server group is also used in overflow situations. If all the servers in the real server group reach their maximum connections limit, Alteon activates the backup server or real server group to provide additional processing power until resources become available on one of the original servers.
