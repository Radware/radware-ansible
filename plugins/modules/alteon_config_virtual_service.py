      server_port:
        description:
          - Specifies the Layer 4 TCP or UDP port on which the real servers listen for this service.
          - This parameter must be specified only when all real servers listen for the service on a port that is different from the service port. For all other cases it should be left empty (0).
          - The real server port can alternatively be defined at real server level, allowing for different listening ports per server.
        required: false
        default: 0

          - Available protocols vary according to the application selected.
          - C(tcp)-For load balancing a TCP service.
          - C(udp)-For load balancing a UDP service.
          - C(tcpAndUdp)-(Available for IP applications only.) For load balancing TCP and UDP services. When this option is selected, IPsec and ICMP are included in the services to be load balanced.
          - C(stateless)-No session table entry is created. Because no session is created, you have to bind to a new server every time.
        required: false
        default: tcp
        choices:
        - udp
        - tcp

      direct_server_return:
        description:
          - Specifies whether to allow the servers to respond directly to the client, without passing through Alteon. This is useful for sites where large amounts of data flow from servers to clients, such as with content providers or portal sites that typically have asymmetric traffic patterns.
          - Direct Server Return allows the server to respond directly to the client, without passing through Alteon. This is useful for sites where large amounts of data flow from servers to clients, such as with content providers or portal sites that typically have asymmetric traffic patterns.
          - When Direct Server Return is enabled, Alteon translates only the destination MAC address to the real server MAC address, and not the destination IP. On the servers you must define a loopback interface with the virtual server IP address.
          - Direct Server Return and content-intelligent Layer 7 load balancing cannot be performed at the same time because content-intelligent load balancing requires that all frames go back to the Alteon for connection splicing.
        required: false

          - Note-Additional persistence methods can be achieved using an AppShape++ script.
          - C(clientip)-Uses the client IP address as the session identifier, and associates all connections from the same client with the same real server until the client becomes inactive, and the persistent entry is aged out of the session table.
          - Different services from the same client may not map to the same server.
          - C(cookie)-Uses a cookie header or a URI cookie as an identifier, and associates all HTTP requests with the same cookie value to the same server.
          - Available only for HTTP and HTTPS (with SSL offload) applications.
          - If the cookie expiration time is greater than the virtual service Persistency Timeout value, timed out requests will not be persistent.
          - C(disabled)-Disables persistence for this service.
          - C(sslid)-Alteon records the SSL session ID and server, and directs all subsequent SSL sessions which present the same session ID to the same real server.
          - Available only for HTTPS and SSL services without SSL offload.
          - Alteon does not support the SSL ID option when you set the virtual service Delayed Binding option to Force Proxy.

          - Specifies the cookie persistence mode.
          - C(rewrite)-The server inserts a persistency cookie in the response but Alteon, and not the network administrator, rewrites it, eliminating the need for the server to generate cookies for each client.
          - C(passive)-The Web server embeds a cookie in its response to the client. Alteon records the specified cookie value and server, and forwards subsequent requests carrying the same cookie value to the same server.
          - Available only for HTTP services and HTTPS services with SSL offload.
          - C(insert)-Alteon generates a cookie value, inserts the Set-Cookie header in the server response, and records the cookie value and the server. All subsequent HTTP requests carrying this cookie value are forwarded to the same server.
          - Available only for HTTP services and HTTPS services with SSL offload (the default persistence type for these services).
        required: false
        default: passive

        description:
          - Specifies whether to enable or disable session mirroring on the selected virtual service.
          - Session mirroring synchronizes the state of active connections with the standby Alteon to prevent service interruptions in case of failover.
          - Session mirroring is recommended for long-lived TCP connections, such as FTP, SSH, and Telnet connections. Session mirroring for protocols characterized by short-lived connections such as UDP and in many cases HTTP, is not necessary. Radware recommends that you use session mirroring only when you need to maintain the state of a long connection.

          - When the clients and servers have different IP versions (IPv4/v6 gateway conversion is performed).
          - When source IP translation is enabled for HTTP or HTTPS with SSL offload service, Alteon enables automatic inserting on the service of an X-Forwarded-For header carrying the original client IP.
