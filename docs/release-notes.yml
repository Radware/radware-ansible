Notes:
1. In Ansible log, if there are words that include the complete user password string, the text is displayed as ******* (for example, if the password is "are" and in the log you have the word Radware, it appears as Radw******). This is a general Ansible limitation and thus it is recommended to use complex passwords. 
2. Alteon key fields accept only letters, numbers, underscore “_”, hyphen “-“ and dot “.”. In addition use of “#” in a key would cause Ansible to remove the text after this character from the REST API URL sent to Alteon (according to RFC 398) which will create on Alteon an entry with a different key.

Known Limitations: 
1. When you set a password, Ansible reports that a change was not performed (changed=0) even when the action was executed successfully.
2. When running the Ansible module, "alteon_device_facts", MP CPU might reach 100%. This may cause performance issues such as slow web UI and SSH operations, and unstable connectivity to the MNG port default gateways and GSLB remote sites.
